## This version of GeoMoose is highly experimental!

The code is subject to change at any time and we welcome aggressive Pull Requests. :)

## Design philosophy

GeoMoose 4.0 is intended to be a cloud-first approach to a Web-based GIS system.
The ultimate goal of the version 4.0-series is to attain the following:

- Support the "90%" workflow for many web-based GIS users. This includes:

    - Investigating datasets and extracting subsets from them using both geometry and attribute queries.
    - Viewing and comparing aerial imagery.

- Only require a web-server or "bucket" to host the site. No CGI or service installation needed.
- To make easy things easy and hard things do able. Most sites will really need the following:

    - The ability to convert and use their own data.
    - The ability to add a logo and relevant links to other sites.
    - Customize cartography with little effort.
